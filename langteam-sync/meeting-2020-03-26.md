Most people are in favor of adding `"C unwind"`

Niko:

> We were saying that it seems like at this point it would make sense to make a revised RFC that states

> add "C unwind"
> clarifies that all unwinding across a C ABI is UB except the case of:
> * forced unwind where no destructors are on stack
> 
> requires an abort guard in the case of a extern "C" fn foo() compiled with panic=unwind (to avoid UB)
> 
> declares that unwinding across a "C unwind" ABI is currently
> * permitted for exceptions that arose from a Rust panic
> * "not yet specified" for foreign exceptions (that will be follow-up work)
