Centril: rather not see "unspecified behavior" (at least this definition) added
as new RFC; apparent preference for "implementation-defined" behavior. But,
likes idea of RFCs from this WG defining their own terminology

ScottMCM: "opposite perspective - many disagreements in Discord about what's
'really' undefined", would be helpful to have a standardized definition of
"unspecified behavior"
